This is an advanced periodic table for the fx-9860 calculator series.
It is intended to be used for students who are studying chemistry at an advanced level (firts year college). I'll keep adding features to this project as I need them or as anyone requests them.

If anyone would like to contribute to this project or to fork in order to port it to other calculators, please, be my guest (actually github is the host, but you  probably got it ;} ).
